# Faint circumstellar emission in directly imaged planet systems: The infrared excesses of HD 116434 and 51 Eri.

The high rate of infrared excess detections towards stars discovered to host wide-orbit planets by direct imaging is intriguing, as it may provide a link between planets and planetesimal belts (the 'debris disks'), and thus key information about how these systems formed. This correlation is 2-3sigma significant for A and F-type host systems, but only if the bias towards observing excess systems in search of these planets is ignored, so awaits future work that uses an unbiased sample. The possible existence of this trend motivates careful searches for infrared excesses in all systems with directly imaged planets, and consideration of the planetary system architecture in each case. Here the system HD 116434, host to a planet at a projected separation of 92au, is reconsidered, and shown to have a 4sigma significant 24um excess that must originate interior to the orbit of HD 116434 b. JWST and ALMA follow-up is encouraged to confirm the excess, and test the possibility that it originates from Be star-like stellar wind emission rather than a debris disk. The disk around 51 Eridani is also reconsidered; a synthesis of previous results finds that only a single temperature component is needed to model the disk spectrum, and that the location of this belt relative to the planet (projected separation of 13au) is unclear. When dust optical properties and collisional evolution are considered, the most probable location is exterior to the planet 51 Eri b. Thus, while conclusions on the planet-disk correlation await a detailed and unbiased sample analysis, work in the meantime remains inspired by the diverse nature and architectures of individual systems with directly imaged planets.
